# Real-time-face-detection-with-Python

When your web camera sees a person it opens a website (maybe music video) on your browser or by using SMTP you can send email to anyone when your camera detects a person. Simply just put the necessary information like the destination mail adress use the send_mail() function or if you are bored and you wanna listen a good music when you arrive home simply put the URL of your favourite song and call the open_web function which is already implemented. You can even use this as a security system for instance when someone enters your room it can send you a notification e mail.
